# Superstore_Analysis_Model_dashboard
I have created a dashboard using Powe-Bi which displays the superstore sales,profit, quantities of order and other necessary details for different type of products and other categorical variables. I have used various pictorial representations in dashboards, Table and matrices.I have also used power query editor to calculate the cost of the product and same has been directly by using formula as well.
we have created some really useful insights to help in increasing the sales and profit.
the size of the file is large and it cannot be opened directly in github.You can download the file and view it
